###### Introduction

"Easter's Eggs" does not refer to the secret-codes in video games.

Define an 'egg' as a simple example that helps you understand, or grow, some code.

I like to keep examples/eggs around for reference, and wanted to share with the world. 

Most examples are done via tests.

There are some 'golf' examples from [Code Golf](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com). Note golfing uses a style of programming that is hideous for 'real' code.

###### Requirements

* uses Java 8 (surprise!)
* uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org/)
