###### Introduction

"Easter's Eggs" does not refer to the secret-codes in video games.

Define an 'egg' as a simple example that helps you understand, or grow, some code.

I like to keep examples/eggs around for reference, and wanted to share with the world. 

Most examples are done via tests.

###### Requirements

-- uses Java 8 (surprise!)
-- uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org/)
